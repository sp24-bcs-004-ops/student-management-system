 Team Reflection — Week 4 Project

 Member 1: [Muhammad Sohaib]
I worked on implementing the core Doubly Linked List operations such as insert, delete, and traversal.  
This task helped me understand pointer manipulation and memory safety.  
If given more time, I would add an iterator or a graphical visualization.


 Member 2: [Sarim Imran]
I focused on building the Stack using the DLL and ensuring that push/pop/top worked correctly.  
I learned how abstract data structures can be built on top of others.  
With more time, I would implement error-handling menus and input validation.
