# Kaizen Review — Week 3

| What was built | Problem / Limitation found | Improvement idea | Team member responsible | Expected impact |
|----------------|---------------------------|----------------|------------------------|----------------|
| Student Records using Doubly Linked List | Data lost after program closes (no file saving) | Add file save/load (CSV or JSON) | Ahmed | Records remain even after program closes |
| Undo feature using Stack | Stack size limited to 50 | Use dynamic memory to allow unlimited undo | Sara | Can undo all deletions without limit |
| Search and Delete operations | Linear search slow for large data | Implement index or hash map for faster search | Bilal | Faster performance for large number of students |
